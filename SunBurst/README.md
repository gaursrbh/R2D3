## SunBurst Chart

See D3 working example [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373)

### Action in R
Prepare data in R so that it can be fed to the D3 template

One suitable usecase is output of *hclust* tree

We will use *RJSONIO* package to convert the output to required JSON format

### Bridge to D3
Using *whisker* package, data will be combined with the template

### Action in D3
Only changing the incoming JSON file. No chart config is changed. 
Again no help provided here. Get your hands dirty with D3 JS code.
